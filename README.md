# Lending_club

This project is for a consumer finance company which works in lending loans to customers. When the company receives a loan application, it has to make a decision based on the applicantâ€™s profile.  

The data given to us has the information about loan applicants and if they Defaulted or not. The objective is to identify patterns in the data that if a person is likely to default or not, which may be used for denying him the loan or reducing the amount of loan and also lending risky applicants at a higher interest rate, etc.

 

We will use EDA to understand what consumer and loan attributes influence the tendency of a default.
